First, I will need to create a lab in order to start testing network and operating systemm security. To do this, I have instaleld Windows 2012 into Virtualbox and created a fake company called Oscorp which will have 50 employees with an Active Directory to manage users and resources.  I have also installed Pfsense to act as a firewall. Pfsense will provide DHCP, DNS, Snort, Suricata IDS, Squid proxy, NTOPNG and will forward firewall logs to grafana.
