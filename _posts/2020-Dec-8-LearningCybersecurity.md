title: Learning Cybersecurity
---

This page will show my progress as I learn cybersecurity. My goal is to be on a Red or Blue team. I am starting by studying for Security+ and completing my BS in Cybersecurity at Norwich. Afterwards I will be working on the CySA+ and build a homelab. I will also go through CTFS such as Overthewire and HTB. I will need to focus on learning programming skills such as Python before moving on to Pentest+ and eventually OSCP.
